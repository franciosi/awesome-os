## Papers

"[Exokernel: An Operating System Architecture for Application-Level Resource Management](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mosharaf/Readings/Exokernel.pdf) (1995) by Dawson R. Engler et al.

"[The Multikernel: A new OS architecture for scalable multicore systems](https://www.sigops.org/s/conferences/sosp/2009/papers/baumann-sosp09.pdf)" (2009) by Andrew Baumann et al. SOSP '09

This paper describes the multikernel design approach to operating system kernels, which aims to improve scalability, and support heterogenenous and diverse hardware. There's also an awesome [retrospective](https://www.sigops.org/2021/fish-in-a-barrel-an-insiders-retrospective-of-the-sosp09-multikernel-paper/).

"[Unikernels: Library Operating Systems for the Cloud](https://anil.recoil.org/papers/2013-asplos-mirage.pdf) (2013) by Anil Madhavapeddy et al. ASPLOSâ€™13

"[Arrakis: The Operating System is the Control Plane](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi14/technical-sessions/presentation/peter)" (2014) by Simon Peter et al. OSDI '14

"[IX: A Protected Dataplane Operating System for High Throughput and Low Latency](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-belay.pdf)" (2014) by Adam Belay et al. OSDI '14

"[Multiprogramming a 64 kB Computer Safely and Efficiently](https://www.tockos.org/assets/papers/tock-sosp2017.pdf)" (2017) by Amit Levy et al. SOSP '17.

This paper details an operating system design where the type-safety of Rust programming language provides memory protection on MMU-less hardware.
