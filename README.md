## Papers

"[The Multikernel: A new OS architecture for scalable multicore systems](https://www.sigops.org/s/conferences/sosp/2009/papers/baumann-sosp09.pdf)" (2009) by Andrew Baumann et al. SOSP '09

This paper describes the multikernel design approach to operating system kernels, which aims to improve scalability, and support heterogenenous and diverse hardware. There's also an awesome [retrospective](https://www.sigops.org/2021/fish-in-a-barrel-an-insiders-retrospective-of-the-sosp09-multikernel-paper/).
